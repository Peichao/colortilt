Colortilt Psychophysics Experiment
==================================

This repository contains the source code for conducting and analysing
 the "colortilt"ยน but, experiment with variable stimulus patch sizes.

For displaying the stimuli, the [iris](https://github.com/wachtlerlab/iris)
 software suite is used.

Analysis code is located in the `analysis` folder. Result figures
ready for publication can be via the `paper.sh` script. For this
to work the environment variable `EXPFILE` has to be set to the
location of the main experiment control file.

For more information about the experiment and the data itself
can be found under:
